# API_Postman

This repository contains a Postman collection for API testing of a sample **Booker API** project.

## 📚 What I Learned

Working on this project helped me understand and practice the following key concepts in API testing:

### ✅ Basics of API Testing:
- Understanding RESTful APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Understanding the structure of API requests and responses
- Status codes and their meanings (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500, etc.)

### 🧪 Postman Fundamentals:
- Creating and organizing collections
- Writing and executing requests
- Adding query parameters, headers, and body data
- Using variables (global, collection, environment)

### 🛠 Scripting in Postman:
- Writing test scripts using JavaScript
- Validating response status codes and response bodies
- Using `pm.expect()` assertions
- Setting and using dynamic variables between requests

### 🔁 Automation & Execution:
- Running a full collection using Collection Runner
- Using data files for data-driven testing
- Exporting and importing collections and environments
